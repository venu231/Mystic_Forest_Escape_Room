  utter_help:
    - text: "  This is a text based adventure game. You're able to pick up items and you're
        also able to combine them in order to solve puzzles. You can try to `look` 🔍 and
        items, you might be able to `pick up` 🫳 items and you can try to `use` items on
        other objects. Before you're able to combine items you first need to pick them
        up. If you get stuck, feel free to ask for a hint!"
